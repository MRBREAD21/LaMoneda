# OneRealm

An open-source [Realm of the Mad God](https://www.realmofthemadgod.com/) designed for advanced cross-verification,
moderation, and raid management.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this bot is to simplify verification and raid management in any Realm Discord server. This bot,
which represents a huge overhaul of [ZeroRaidBot](https://github.com/ewang2002/ZeroRaidBot), is designed with
customization in mind.

## Technologies

OneRealm actually consists of two projects: the bot itself (this repository);
and [RealmSharper](https://github.com/ewang2002/RealmEyeSharper/), which is how the bot gets its data from RealmEye and
provides other services like screenshot parsing.

### OneRealm

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### [RealmSharper](https://github.com/ewang2002/RealmEyeSharper/)

- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet)
- [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet)

Since the creation of this bot, I am not affiliated with any major Discord servers. If I am a developer in a server, I
am only there to provide assistance.

## Setup & Support

I will not provide support for anyone that plans on self-hosting this bot. However, there are other similar projects out
there that may suit your needs.

- [ZeroRaidBot](https://github.com/ewang2002/ZeroRaidBot) - The original open-source bot that I created. This project is
  in maintenance mode, though I may revisit it when I have time; I will only fix bugs and update dependencies as needed.
  Written in TypeScript and uses MongoDB.

- [Rotmg-Discord-Bot](https://github.com/Jacobvs/Rotmg-Discord-Bot) - Another open-source bot created
  by [Jacob](https://github.com/Jacobvs). Written in Python and uses MySQL.
