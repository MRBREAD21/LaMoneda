An open-source [Realm of the Mad God](https://www.realmofthemadgod.com/) Discord bot designed for cross-verification,
moderation, and raid management.

The name was inspired by Ooga-Booga, another RotMG Discord bot.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this bot is to simplify verification and raid management in any Realm Discord server. This bot,
which is a rewrite of [ZeroRaidBot](https://github.com/ewang2002/ZeroRaidBot), is designed with
customization in mind.

## Technologies

Tooga-Booga actually consists of two projects: the bot itself (this repository);
and [RealmSharper](https://github.com/ToogaInc/RealmEyeSharper), which is how the bot gets its data from RealmEye and
provides other services like screenshot parsing.
