# Some Notes
Here are a few notes to keep in mind as you use this bot.

## Bug Reports
It's not uncommon to find one, two, or many bugs in any of my projects. Since I primarily work as a solo developer, 
a lot of bugs tend to evade me. 

If you find a bug, please let me know by either:
- Submitting a Github [Issue](https://github.com/ewang2002/OneLifeBot/issues).
- Submitting a bug report by using the `;reportbug` command on the official bot.

The time that it takes for me to fix a bug depends on the severity. Generally speaking, it can take me between 4 and 
48 hours to fix a rather severe bug.

## Feature Requests
You are absolutely free to send in feature requests. There are two ways you can do this.
- Submit a Github [Issue](https://github.com/ewang2002/OneLifeBot/issues).
- Use the `;feedback` command.

Generally speaking, I do *not* entertain feature requests **unless** all of the following are satisfied:
- The feature is in high demand *across* a majority of the servers the bot is in. 
- The feature is either:
  - Consistent between servers. That is, I should not have to hardcode changes in the code just so a particular 
    server gets what it wants. 
  - *Or*, if it needs to be customizable, it should be relatively easy to configure (on the server staff's part) and 
    relatively easy for me to code (dynamic configuration commands are generally a pain to code).
- The feature is aligned with the bot's purpose. In other words, I don't want to add features that aren't related to 
  the bot (so don't ask me to, for example, add an economy feature to the bot). 
- The feature is not unreasonable for me to add. For example, if you want me to add mini-sections in sections, I'm 
  going to reject the feature request. 

In the list above, one (common) feature that I will most likely reject is custom quotas/logging on a per-server 
basis.

Assuming all the above is met, please give me **at least** a one-week notice to work on the feature. Alternatively, 
you are free to fork the code, add the feature to your fork, and send in a pull request.
